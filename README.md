# Rutgers Fall 2021 CS336 Group 54 Airline Portal

Admin username: admin
Admin password: admin
Admin implementation, including database design, stored procedures, 
and website interface created entirely by Kevin Lauducci.

Customer and Representative accounts can be managed through the admin functionality.
I have created customer and representative home pages but they are empty as of now.
Attached SQL file will create the database which worked with admin functionality.

Shivan did user functionality part 1.

Code borrowed from cs336Sample project
